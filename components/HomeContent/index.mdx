I am presently working at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) as a Frontend Engineer and previously worked at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/) and [Tata 1mg](https://www.1mg.com/).

* ‣ I really enjoy developing robust web apps by following functional programming paradigm.
* ‣ If I have to highlight one thing that I enjoy the most during development it has to be the product architecture and the conversations around designs.
* ‣ Along with the product development I have a keen interest in contributing to infrastructure related tasks.
